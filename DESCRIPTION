Description: Provides functions for fitting continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) models 
    with hidden states, specifically designed for analyzing epithelial-mesenchymal 
    transition (EMT) dynamics coupled with secondary cellular processes such as 
    cell cycle progression. The package includes methods for estimating emission 
    matrices from time-course data and fitting generator matrices using maximum 
    likelihood estimation.
